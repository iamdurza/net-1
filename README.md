# Network Hacking Blah

```python
#!/usr/env/bin python-3      =     shabang
```

Here are my sample commands =
* `ifconfig` - shows net adresses and interfaces
* `ipconfig`- kind of like 'ifconfig' on linux but lam
* `windows-key + r + cmd` - open disgusting 10 year old windows terminal
* `ping`- generic command to check *latency* (lag) and up-ness
* `LAN` = local area network
